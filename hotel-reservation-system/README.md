# 🏨 Maru's Beachfront Rooms Hotel Reservation System

This is the frontend repository for our **Hotel Reservation System** project. The design is based on a collaborative Figma file, and we are currently in the development phase of translating the design into working HTML/CSS/JS code.

---

## 📌 To-Do

- [ ] **Import Figma Design** – Convert the Figma prototype into frontend code (HTML, CSS, JS).
- [ ] **Assign Pages** – Each member must *dibs* their assigned webpage from the Figma design.
- [ ] **Complete Individual Webpages** – Each member is responsible for coding their chosen webpage based on the Figma layout.
- [ ] **Integrate UI Components** – Ensure all pages are visually consistent and follow the shared design system.

## 🧑‍💻 Development Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Choose a webpage from the Figma file and notify the group (dibs it).
3. Work on your page in the `pages/` directory. Name your file appropriately (e.g., `booking.html`, `homepage.html`).
4. Follow our HTML/CSS standards and structure. Use comments where needed.
5. Once complete, push your changes to your own branch and create a pull request for merging.
